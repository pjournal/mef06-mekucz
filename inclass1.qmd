## The number of planes according to manufacturer brands

We are talking about NewYork. It is acceptable that BOEING has the highest number of planes, considering that BOEING is an American manufacturer.
```{r}
planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer)%>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```


## Investigating planes that has more than 2 engines; sorted according to the year.

Big Planes, big engines....
```{r}

planes %>%
  filter(engines>2)%>%
  arrange(year,desc(year))
```


## BONUS - Quick Guys !

Total number of flights that had delayed departure but arrived before scheduled time grouped by the carrier. United Airlines has the most number of flights in this category.
```{r}
flights%>%
  filter(dep_delay>0 & arr_delay<0)%>%
  group_by(carrier)%>%
  summarize(count=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
