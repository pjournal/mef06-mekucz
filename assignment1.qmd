RStudio Global 2022

This session of the conference was hold by **Melissa Van Bussel**. The title of the session is: *Achieving a seamless workflow between R, Python and SAS from within RStudio*

Melissa mentions about the need of using open source software in corporate entities and government bodies without expliciting personal information. She mentions about how Canadian government is utilizing open source software such as R or Python by keeping personal information strictly confidential.

Strict data is processed under SAS platform and pushed to other platforms by using opensource code prepared by SAS Software. SASPy is an open source Python package that allows Python coders to access SAS data and analytics capabilities.

## Some R Posts

### Writing Functions in R

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

Creating a Function To create a function, use the function() keyword:

```{r}
my_function <- function() { # create a function with the name my_function
  print("Hello World!")
}

my_function
```

### Using Pie Chart in R

Pie Charts A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.

Use the pie() function to draw pie charts:

```{r}
# Create a vector of pies
x <- c(10,20,30,40)

# Display the pie chart
pie(x)
```

### Data type of an object in R

To find the data type of an object you have to use **class()** function. The syntax for doing that is you need to pass the object as an argument to the function **class()** to find the data type of an object.

```{r}
# A simple R program
# to find data type of an object
 
# Logical
print(class(TRUE))
 
# Integer
print(class(3L))
 
# Numeric
print(class(10.5))
 
# Complex
print(class(1+2i))
 
# Character
print(class("12-04-2020"))
```
